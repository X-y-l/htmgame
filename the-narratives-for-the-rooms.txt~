Tragedy besets your party as a cave-in strands you in the darkest depths of the dungeon for days. As your rations dwindle, it becomes clear to each of you that you must supplement them for the sake of morale. How do you gather more food?

It's becoming increasingly clear that the stone giant's assault on the barricade is unceasing. If you are to survive, you must create somethinga distraction to hold the giant's attention when it breaches so that your archers can surround the monster. How do you hold its attention?

"It's pronounced 'ch-ai-mber' you miserable ingrate!" one of your party members calls out, an unusual warcry to say the least. "Not ch-ah-mber! I'll kill you! I'll kill all of you!" It seems things are escalating rather drastically. You should probably nip this in the bud before it turns into a full-on mutiny. What do you do?

As you reach the end of the corridor, you see three towering armoured spectres, their eyes aglow. All around, the voices of the departed whisper to you, "One door leads to freedom, the others certain doom. Of the three figure, one is ever truthful, another tells only lies, and the last stabs would-be logicians asking tricky questions." How will you overcome this puzzle?

As you go to check on your companions' progress, you see them wailing and gnashing their teeth. "Alas, the path forward is impossible!" they cry. "Of the three doors, one is clearly for washing oneself, one is a place to hang your garments, and the last is clearly marked with a warning not to disturb! Thus ends our brave foray into this ancient tomb." It seems your companions are beset by madness, what do you do?

As you reach the centre of the room, you catch yourself just in time; unbeknownst to you there was a pit reaching from wall to wall in the middle of the room. The walls of the pit are vertical, and the gap is eleven foot wide. How do you cross the pit?

You freeze, the moment you enter this next chamber. It seems that another adventuring party had been exploring this dungeon ahead of you. Emphasis on the word 'had'. A gaggle of ghouls are feasting on the remains of your predecessors. They don't appear to have noticed you yet, but one wrong move could bring down the entire pack upon you at once. How do you deal with this... infestation?

After slaying a dark mage sequestered in a labyrinth, you and your party members are dividing its possessions amongst yourselves. Part way into a drawer containing odds and ends, you pause. It's been some time since you've seen your companions. You rush from room to room looking for them, until you finally check the library. Your companions are there, weeping openly around a single book. "How?" they cry. "How are we to go on, knowing that free will is an impossibility? That everything we do is pre-ordained or some result of purely random forces?" You sigh, gathering your wits. How do you defuse this nihilistic whinging?

You are some distance into this latest chamber, when the lit torches adorning the walls are suddenly extinguished, all at once. You hear the unmistakeable chittering of giant cockroaches, growing louder as they surge towards you. You have but a moment to act. What do you do?

As you enter this latest chamber, you spot that the floor is adorned with large individual tiles in a grid, around five foot across. Something feels off. As you ponder exactly what this is, you spot Steve jogging ahead with reckless abandon. Before you can say a word, a tile that Steve stands on sinks into the floor. There is a sizeable explosion, and Steve goes, quite frankly, everywhere. It has made rather a mess, to be perfectly honest with you. Luckily, it was just Steve and not someone of import. Clearly, your path ahead requires a more careful hand. How do you proceed?

You enter a room, and in the centre is a crude wooden stand, with a troll sittingbehind it. The sign above reads 'Trol Boof'. It appears it expects payment from you to proceed. The price is difficult to read, but clearly has far too many digits. How do you decide to pass?

It seems your adventure has to be put on hold for now. Your local liege lord expects tribute from your adventuring. He has very exacting standards. Nothing too flashy or gaudy, but nothing a commoner would ever be able to own. No strong food or drink, but nothing tastless. Nothing too obvious of purpose, but also nothing where he cannot grasp the subtlety. In short, he is impossible to please. What gift do you decide to give him, and why?

You enter a room with a fabulous amount of treasure covering the floor. You are overjoyed, until you spot the large dragon partially buried in all the coins. You might be able to grab a treasure or two, but you must be careful not to disturb the dragon, at least not unless you are prepared to finish the job. What do you do?

The door to the next room is barred with numerous locks. Attempts to pick the door
