The Duck King
"MWAAAAACK!!!" a devastating quack shakes a wave of stalactites to the ground. *Thwap*, *thwap*, *thwap*. Webbed feet slap the ground like bodies hitting the floor. A titanic foul fowl enters the arena, its head a regal green, its brown and white feathers like mottled robes. On its head sits a majestic crown that seems to emit a warding aura. The crown is held in place by a ring of ruffled feathers.  Around its feet are hideous feral duck-human creatures that quack in the light of the moonlight streaming down from the skylight. How do you take out the swarms of wereducks, knock the giant crown from the giant feathered head, and deal the devastating final blow?
In the room there is a gigantic duck pond, a roaring fire with a pan full of birdseed roasting in it, stalactites are falling from the ceiling with every step the Duck King takes, and the floor is covered in squeaky rubber ducks.
